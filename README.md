# Instance-Adaptive-LSH-Forests

Code accompanying the instance-adaptive LSH forests

# My Paper Title

This repository is the official implementation of "Learning to Hash Robustly, with Guarantees".

# Description of Folder

The user will have to clone their own version of Eigen 3.3.9 repository (https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), and download the MNIST dataset in binary format (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). 

The user will also have to adjust the "dir_path" variable in tree_comp.cpp, tree_main.cpp.


# Usage

Set ANN parameters r and c in the tree_main.cpp file. The parameter œÅ is simply 1/c. 

# Some "Learned" distributions on MNIST!
